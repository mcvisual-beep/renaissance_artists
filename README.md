# renaissance_artists

The purpose of this map is to provide geographical/temporal context to the time period of Renaissance History. When studying history, it can be easy to get lost in the list of names and events and forget when and where individuals lived. This map will use data from a specific movement in history to demonstrate one way of analyzing historical figures in the context of space and time.

This map shows the birthplaces of many Renaissance Artists who were born between the years 1300 and 1500AD. Clicking on the icons will provide more information about the artist and information about what was happening the year that artist was born.
